This repository represents a Chloropleth map of the United States depicting alcohol usage per person per state.
The darker colors represent a higher amount of alcoholic beverages consumed per person while the lighter colors represent less alcohol consumption.
The measurments are in gallons which can be understood by the custom legend on the right side of the map.
